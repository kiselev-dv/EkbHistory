    The day of foundation of the Yekaterinburg is 7th November, 1723.
    This is the day of first test-run of finery hammers of new factory.
    </p>
    <p>
    Original design made by Tatishew uses 40 finery hammers and 4 blast furnaces.

    That should be the best equiped and the most productive factory of that times.
